        <h1> DEVELOPERS </h1>
        <p> As of right now, I am currently working with video game developers
            <br>
            who are either new to the industry, or have been working within it
            <br>
            for a long time, by helping them with user interface design that
            <br>
            they require for the kind of game they are working on. The following
            <br>
            developers are mentioned below.
        </p>

        <h2>Studio: Fully Upgraded</h2>
        <p>Based in Toronto, Canada, this studio is currently focused on building
        <br>
        a full-fledged mobile game app that is focused on conquering planes
        <br>
        occupied by inhabitants in a dystopian Earth, by working with teammates
        <br>
        to complete heists.
