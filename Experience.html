        <center><h1>MY EXPERIENCE</h1></center>

        <h2><center>Development Experience</h2></center>
        <center><p> I have been developing games since 2014, starting with the development
            <br>
            software GameMaker and progressing up to the use of the Unity engine to
            <br>
            work on some of the projects you're looking at below. I've worked on genres
            <br>
            ranging from first-person games to the focus of education. Interested? Take
            <br>
            a look at some of the things I've done in the past.

        <center><b>Description:</b>My first game development journey began in 2014 when I decided
        <br>
        to work on my very first game without any level of coding experience. As the game files
        <br>
        were lost due to a corrupt USB, my recollection of the game was that it were to be an
        <br>
        Megaman inspired title that were to take place during medieval times, similar to what
        <br>
        you'd see in the retro game Castlevania. It was developed with GameMaker Studio, and took
        <br>
        a few weeks to make to my memory.

        <h2><center>SHIFT</h2></center>
        <center><p><b>Description:</b> Beginning development in 2014, the goal of Shift was to
        <br>
        make use of the simple physics engine of Unity to make a game where you are shooting
        <br>
        at turrets through basic gameplay mechanics. You can try out the game by clicking the
        <br>
        button below!
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> As this was the very first game I ever created, there will be plenty of bugs
        <br>
        and glitches which makes it difficult to play. Regardless, this is mainly for documenting
        <br>
        purposes, so please play with caution.
