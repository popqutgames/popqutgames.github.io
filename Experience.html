        <h1>CONTEXT</h1>
        <p>
            I have been developing games since 2014, starting with the development
            <br>
            software GameMaker and progressing up to the use of the Unity engine to
            <br>
            work on some of the projects you're looking at below. I've worked on genres
            <br>
            ranging from first-person games to the focus of education. Interested? Take
            <br>
            a look at some of the things I've done in the past.

        <h2>2008</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Before I had any access to a computer, I would use my parents laptop
            <br>
            to try to figure out how to make games. Considering my age, I had no
            <br>
            experience in playing video games apart from occasionally playing Mario
            <br>
            on the GameBoy Advance. Regardless, I was determined to seek an answer,
            <br>
            at which I came to a limit of resources considering how tools used today
            <br>
            were brand new at the time. Whether it was Unity, or even Unreal Engine,
            <br>
            at the time, it wasn't easy to access such software, nor did I have the
            <br>
            tools to install them. But, regardless, I was able to come across a few
            <br>
            websites that offered subscriptions to make games. I did not have enough
            <br>
            money or knowledge at the time to know what that meant, though, I managed
            <br>
            to access the websites built-in engine to throw together assets and make
            <br>
            myself a platformer. It wasn't anything big at the time, but the simple task
            <br>
            of making a simple game intrigued me, though it had not crossed my mind for 
            <br>
            several years after that.

        <h2>2014</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>Alzerath</h2>
        <p>
            Around the summer of 2014, thanks to the increasingly growing gaming community
            <br>
            on YouTube around the same time period, I was inspired to make a deep dive into
            <br>
            game development myself. Since I had access to a computer, I was able to use tools
            <br>
            that were more up to date at the time. Ultimately, since I couldn't pay for a game
            <br>
            engine, I landed on a free trial of GameMaker Studio. This time, I had a goal in mind,
            <br>
            at which I wanted to develop a video game inspired by Megaman, set in a medieval world.
            <br>
            This was an inspiration I had after the game 'Shovel Knight' was released, henceforth
            <br>
            I tried my best to pursue the task in mind. After watching videos on putting together
            <br>
            sprite animations, and programming collisions between objects, I was able to create
            <br>
            a very early version of the game, which unfortunately is lost as of now as the file
            <br>
            was corrupted in the middle of a file transfer. Regardless, it was the spark that brought
            <br>
            me to help make video games today. The game title 'Alzerath' was somewhat random, but
            <br>
            could have been inspired by medieval board games and how the characters were named.
            <br>

        <br>
        <h2>SHIFT.exe</h2>
        <p>
            After taking a year off to focus on more important things such as education, I eventually spent
            <br>
            the summer of 2015 building a game based on another inspiration I had. At the time, sites such as
            <br>
            itch.io, and GitHub had really hit the new medium for how games and software were shared. Although
            <br>
            I did have money to purchase games, one particular game came at no cost, it was called 'Sonic Ball'.
            <br>
            The use of Unity to make such a title inspired me to get into learning the basics of the engine,
            <br>
            and frankly I had just the PC to download and build projects on top of it.
            <br>
            It was widely held popular amongst my social circle at the time, and some peers even offered to
            <br>
            help me out with its development. The project, with major gaps in production between the years,
            <br>
            had eventually reached a certain version of itself that was somehwat playable, but it had not
            <br>
            fit to my expectations. Regardless, without having to work at a company, I still managed to
            <br>
            collaborate with others who had similar initiatives as I did at the time. Below, is the very
            <br>
            first version of the game, I will remaster the final version soon.

        <h2>Lost in NY</h2>
        <p>
            During this time period, I had created another Unity game for which its files were also corrupted.
            <br>
            But frankly, it is clear enough in my memory to explain its premise. After going on a brief road trip
            <br>
            to Manhattan, I was inspired eventually build a top-view mobile game about someone who entered
            <br>
            New York City, but was lost in the city so much that they had to find a way out. The game was really
            <br>
            inspired by the struggle to navigate what felt like such a new city to me, and the level was built around
            <br>
            that feeling through a maze-structured version of New York. The game was incomplete due to a lack of textures,
            <br>
            and just time in general to fix such issues. Regardless, it was one of my other inspired projects that I may
            <br>
            consider rebuilding sometime for release.

            As I'm currently in the helm of helping out other game developers, one particular studio
            <br>
            I am helping out goes by the name Fully Upgraded. The team is situated in Toronto, and
            <br>
            offered to help them with developing a title of theirs by the name of Higher Grounds.
            <br>
            Although development is still early, I am currently helping out with 3D modelling, UI design,
            <br>
            as well as some concept art.
